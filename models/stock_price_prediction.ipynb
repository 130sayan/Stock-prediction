      "Tesla reportedly suspends expansion of Shanghai plant   The second phase of the Tesla Shanghai plant expansion project is currently on hold, Tencent News said Wednesday, citing people close to the plant.The project covers an area of 461,100 square meters and is owned by the Shanghai Lingang District Management Committee. The site's auction failed several months ago when there was only one bidder, the report said.Tesla signed a memorandum of cooperation with Lingang in July 2018, announcing the construction of its largest overseas factory outside the United States, the Shanghai Gigafactory, with a planned capacity of 500,000 units. On Jan. 7, 2019, Tesla officially opened the Shanghai Gigafactory with a first phase capacity of 250,000 units. The plant is mainly used for the production of Model 3 and Model Y.On January 7, 2020, Tesla delivered the Model 3 produced at the Shanghai plant to 10 Chinese consumers for the first time and launched the production of Model Y.According to Tencent News, Tesla was previously required to invest RMB 14.08 billion over five years and achieve an output of more than RMB 75 billion by the end of 2023 and generate RMB 2.23 billion in annual tax revenue.Otherwise, Tesla would have to hand over the land but would receive corresponding financial compensation regarding land rental, buildings, and equipment.On April 28, Tesla made an announcement that it had repaid the $614 million loan related to the Shanghai factory expenses early and the related contract was terminated. After this, the unused $758 million under the fixed asset credit line in Tesla's debt and finance lease schedule will no longer be available.A Reuters report on Tuesday mentioned that people familiar with the matter said Tesla has stopped buying land to expand its Shanghai plant due to uncertainty over tensions between the US and China.\n",
      "Like it or not, battery swapping IS the future.It makes the most economical sense in densly populated areas.Extends the life span of any vehicle that adopts it.Increases the re-sale value as new gen batteries can be put into older models.Simplifies the recycling process of depleted batteries.Allows for swap station battery banks to sell stored electricity to the grid while batteries are sitting idle.The only downside I see is the initial setup costs.But that burden is being shared by many of NIOs partners such as Metro and Sinopec.Buy, find the constitution to Hold, get Wealthy.\n",

The EV maker sold 11,671 locally built Model 3 and Model Y cars in China last month, while exporting a further 14,174, according to the China Passenger Car...\n",
      "I think everyone forgets you can charge Nio battery's too, not just swap them. And they have mobile chargers.  They just have multiple ways to allow EV to be convenient and are customer centric.  Yes the infrastructure costs money, bit they have partners, plus it generates residual income. Wait til other vehicles use their swappable battery system.  I'm tired of all the bashing of BaaS which will be one of their larger revenue streams.Of course, also, as battery tech quickly advances ove the next several years BaaS keeps the NIO cars more upto date, which will also mean higher resale value. Don't forget the possible benefits to selling power back to the electrical grid.Enough about swappable battery being a problem, it's also backed by the Chinese government.\n",
      "China's April auto sales rise 8.6%, up for 13th straight month(Adds sales figure for new energy vehicles)Vehicle sales in China rose 8.6% in April versus the same month a year earlier, their 13th consecutive month of gains, industry data showed on Wednesday, as the world's biggest car market leads the sector's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.Sales reached 2.25 million vehicles in April, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, maintained their strong sales momentum, jumping 180%, with 206,000 units sold in the month.NEV makers, such as Nio Inc NIO , Xpeng Inc XPEV and Tesla Inc TSLA , are expanding manufacturing capacity in China, encouraged by a policy of promoting greener vehicles to cut pollution.\n",
      "China News Driving NIO Stock Higher TodayReports today that EV rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is having troubles in China appear to be bullish for NIO stock. Indeed, EV investors appear to be viewing Tesla‚Äôs loss as Nio‚Äôs gain as the race for Chinese market share heats up.According to recent reports, Tesla sold less than 26,000 Chinese-made EVs in April, down from more than 35,000 units in March.These reports, compounded with previous bearish news that China would be moving to restrict the use of Tesla vehicles by government employees and officials, continues to move the needle on TSLA stock. Tesla has seen its share price dip today on this news.Elon Musk has publicly attempted to assuage concerns via talks with Chinese government officials. However, it appears Tesla‚Äôs built-in camera systems are a no-go for Chinese authorities looking to clamp down on American companies following rather bitter diplomatic talks of late.As the ‚Äúgolden child‚Äù of the Chinese EV space, investors in NIO like this news. Less competition means more profit for NIO.\n",

      "Let us all long remember this is the time to buy more shares long term if you believe in this company. I will have some funds ready in a day or two. So I will definitely will be adding to my position. This drop has nothing to do with Nio alone. It's the entire markets being affected right now. I will be adding sometime this week. At these prices what an amazing opportunity for everyone wanting more shares. No one will ever time the markets perfectly. All we can do is take advantage of the low prices as it dips. Sooner or later Nio along with all the EV's will rise up just as fast. I would hate to miss these opportunities to add more. Best of luck longs. We will be just fine long term. Also let us all remember a lot of us were in much lower so we are still very much in the profit zone. Do not listen to the bashers which does not even own shares. Long and strong!\n",

      "Why to buy GE? I completely agree what said in the Q1 2021 investor letter of Longleaf Partners Fund. The letter highlighted a few stocks and General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) is one of them. Here is what the fund said:\"General Electric (GE) (22%, 1.50%), the revitalized Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate, was a top contributor following on its strong 4Q 2020 performance. Fourth-quarter Healthcare results were excellent, with revenues up 6% year-over-year (YoY), operating margins up 3% to 20% and strong FCF conversion. The Power and Renewables segment improved margins due to strength from gas plant services. With flight traffic increasing, Aviation appears likely to begin a multi-year recovery in the second half of this year. GE also swapped its aircraft leasing operations to AerCap for a 46% stake in the combined company, intelligently wrapping up its previously troubled GE Capital financing operations and further decreasing overall leverage. We continue to be impressed by the turnaround work of CEO Larry Culp, and the stock remains discounted against the quality of the three core business segments.‚Äù\n",

I believe GE will retest $13.5 and close above $13.5 next few days and $14 by next Friday. If that happens, GE will breakout the $14.5 and moves to $16 range. GE looks very bullish.

Listen to Culp, the vice president, and the CFO discuss: the core businesses (Renewables + Power + Aviation + Health), headwinds, tailwinds, guidance, revenue, profit, orders, factoring, debt, goals, inflation, losses, timetables, concerns, the pandemic, the reopening, positive cash flow, so good I say it twice, positive cash flow, expectations, possibility of future deals with great specificity & visual aids.  Moreover, you can hear tough questions from leading analyst from credible financials ( i.e. I heard the infamous Tusa for the 1st time) challenge the BIG 3 from GE.  As an investor who is long, it was very insightful and informative.No disrespect to anyone here; but no post, (certainly not mine), can express the true state of affairs for GE as well as that call.

      "Two very important things just happened....Reverse Split - 97 % or 8,536,000,000 shareholders want the reverse split.Me too.the last 264,000 shares or 3% of the outstanding stock voted against the reverse split. The reverse split definitely makes perfect sense to almost everyone.  Everyone got it . Onto another even more interesting thought....Culp had two goals.  The Board granted him a bonus to be paid in stock in 2024 if he stayed and the stock hit certain prices.If the stock hit  $25.12 a share - he would get 9,872,611 shares (worth $248 million)If the stock hit  $33.34 a share - he would get 13,797240 shares (worth $460 million)Then they dropped the goal down to half, but kept the shares awarded the same.  So it mostly is the price he has to reach - not the amount of shares awarded which would remain constant.I am excited because that means Larry Culp will have the get the price up to either $25.12 or $33.34 a share lasting for a month in the next 34 months.He said today - but nobody really heard it - that in 2023 Renewables is on track to have $3 billion free cash flow. As I said in an earlier post, it is mathematically possible for GE to move to that $31 price in the next 2 years.  Aviation $6.8 billion FCF, Medical 3 billion FCF, Renewables $3 billion FCF, and Power $3 billion FCF = $16 billion FCF.  $16 billion x 23 times = $36.80 stok price.I am even more sure since yesterday that it will happen now!written by:Gene   (not the \"G\", \"GE to 0\" or \"Gregg\" who is also posting under the same sign)\n",

      "Here's Craig Irwin from Roth Capital. Reiterates buy with $65 price target.PLUG: Audit Overhang Lifted; Buy for Abundant Business Catalysts in 2021Plug issued a press release indicating it expects to file the 2020 10-K within five business days, signaling an end to the distraction from an accounting review. We expect any restatement to be minor, and focus on positive business trends and upcoming catalysts. 1Q21 Billings are inline and mgmt issued guidance for 2Q21 also inline. We expect short-term catalysts from a Green Hydrogen offtake agreement. Other catalysts include progress in FC trucks (including a new partner), and small FC infrastructure.Plug announced in a press release it expects to file its 2020 10-K, including any restatement, within the next five business days. We expect any restatement to be minor, which is not a reflection of the impact this exercise in accounting diligence has had on the stock. 1Q21 results could be delayed by up to 30 days, given the accounting team was fully engaged handling the KPMG debacle.1Q21 billings inline and guide reiterated. Mgmt indicated in the release that 1Q21 billings were more than $70m with more than $105m expected in 2Q21. Plug also reiterated guidance for $475m and $750m in 2021 and 2022, growing to $1.7bn by 2024.We expect potential Green Hydrogen offtake agreements to be signed soon, given Plug's DOE Loan Guarantee process. Plug is applying for $520m in funding from the Title XVII Federal Loan Guarantee program to support construction of five new Green Hydrogen facilities. With the program review structured in four phases, we expect the current financial diligence phase to move smoothly, and transition into the customer and supplier phase over the next several weeks. The Phase IV and last step is the environmental impact diligence before review and probable award by the DOE loan committee. We expect Plug mgmt to be working fervently to lock in third party offtake agreements for Green Hydrogen, as this would offer a solid indicator of the true market value for Green Hydrogen and the potential for external sales versus internal consumption. We expect economics for third party agreements to be very attractive for Plug Power.Leaving estimates unchanged at this time. We reiterate Buy and $65 price target, using a 60x EV multiple on our 2025 EBITDA estimate of $472m. We see the 60x multiple as fair since this result in 2025 should reflect an early stage of growth, where various market forecasts estimate 18% to 23% of world energy from hydrogen by 2050. We expect the stock to continue trading off datapoints confirming an expanding longer-term business model.Shares of PLUG could see increased volatility due to the high valuation on 2025 estimates, where individual company and industry catalysts, and expectations around catalysts, can both drive material implied changes to long-term hydrogen economy scenarios.VALUATIONWe reiterate Buy and $65 price target, using a 60x EV multiple on our 2025 EBITDA estimate of $472m.

Shares of PLUG could see increased volatility due to the high valuation on 2025 estimates, where individual company and industry catalysts, and expectations around catalysts, can both drive material implied changes to long-term hydrogen economy scenarios.Factors that may impede shares of PLUG from reaching our price target include: (1) higher/lower than expected GenDrive shipments; (2) increasing competition in the fuel cell material handling market; (3) material changes in production costs; and (4) a significant change in relationships with customers or suppliers.RISKSPotential volatility is a risk for equity investors. Shares of Plug Power are trading at a high valuation discounting long-term success in expanding markets, and any lumpy results or delayed milestones could significantly impact valuation.Slower-than-expected GDP growth or weaker-than-expected economic conditions. The overall forklift truck market is highly correlated to GDP growth and overall economic performance. If the U.S. economy experiences a double-dip recession, demand for forklifts could stagnate.Forklift truck manufacturers may decide to vertically integrate fuel cell power systems. OEMs, such as NACCO or Toyota, may begin in-house integration of fuel cell systems into trucks and threaten the company's product line. PLUG limited experience manufacturing at scale. For more than a decade, PLUG was principally an R&D company. The company is just beginning to manufacture its GenDrive products at scale. Higher natural gas prices would decrease IRRS.

      "Float = All the shares issued by a company.Free Float = All the shares available for trading.Short Interest = the percentage of the Float borrowed and not yet returned.Borrow fee = Annual interest rate on a short position.Cost to borrow = How much it costs annually to keep a short position open, this is prorated by the day. I.e. if the stock was priced at $10, and you borrowed 100,000 shares at a borrow fee of 50%. You receive $1,000,000, you will pay $4,109.59 per day until you return the stock plus any margin fees.Days to cover as reported by Ortex, Fintel, etc = How many days at the current average volume it would take to cover ALL the short positions. I want to stress the ALL part. It's not a single entity that holds all the short positions. Lower volume is better for a squeeze. Look at it this way; you own a bank, you gave a hedge fund a credit line. They used this to short a stock. They decide to short 100,000 shares of company XYZ that is trading at $10, the trade is moving against them after 2 days the price has increased to $15, but the average volume traded is 1 million shares. They can close out their position in .1 day. This is not a high risk situation, it doesn't matter how many other short positions are open by others, because you're not worried about covering all the shorts just the ones that your client has open. You ask for a little more collateral and they add more to their account. Now take the same situation but volume has fallen to 10,000 per day, because a bunch of diamond hands have cornered the market, and they're not selling. Now it will take them 10 days to cover and low liquidity in a stock makes prices more volatile, and you as the lender are responsible for supplying the shares in the event that they default. You ask them for a massive amount of collateral. They cannot provide it. You liquidate the collateral they've already given you, and start closing out their position, price goes to the moon because diamond hands won't sell for cheap, and you're left holding the bag.Naked shorts are created by the MARKET MAKERS, not the hedge funds. Market makers have an exemption that allows them to sell \"shares\" that they have yet to locate to keep the markets \"liquid and efficient.\" They are however required to deliver the shares, otherwise it becomes a failure to deliver which in turn costs them fines and increases their risk with the clearing house, requiring them to put up more collateral. If the price of the stock moves higher between their fail and their future purchase they lose money on the trade. The longer they wait to deliver and the more the price moves against them the higher the collateral requirements with the clearing house gets, until margin calls turn into forced liquidation.\n",

Think of concerts from years gone by performed by names like Hendrix, Zeppelin, Elvis, Joplin, Skynyrd, Morrison, and a host of other performers in all musical genres that otherwise may never be seen except in this form.

An explosion in demand with chips being put in things never before. And current capacity is not able to keep up. And its not getting better, its getting worse as all new stuff demands chips every week.

      "Here is my own summary of a May 10 (4:45 PM) \"Zack's Equity Resarch\" article titled \"Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Moves -0.93%: What You Should Know\":1. The recent loss on Monday by Ford was similar to the automotive (autos/tires/trucks) sector loss. So, nothing to worry about... just par.2.  There will be an expected EPS loss of $0.40 in Q2. That, too, is in line with guidance from Ford. However, revenue is expected to be up by over 28%. In my opinion, that's OK until this chip shortage is really sorted out.3. Zack's estimate for 2021 (full year) earnings is $0.95 per share with annual revenue of just over $125 billion. This, to me, indicates an inflection point even though the numbers, I believe, are somewhat conservative. The end of this year could be a breakout period.4. It looks like other analysts will be revising the stock price higher with updated revenue estimate revisions. That's always good news.5. Forward P/E valuation is 12.49 compared to the 16.39 sector average. So, relatively speaking, F is traded at a discount. That's good to know.6. My favorite valuation metric is the PEG ratio (price/earnings to growth ratio). A PEG ratio of 1.0 or lower indicates a fair or discounted valuation. The PEG ratio for Ford is 0.57, very low; in my opinion, Ford is VERY undervalued compared to the automotive sector average PEG ratio of 1.64.   7. Currently, the (cyclical!) automotive sector represents a \"hot\" sector now with plenty of growth potential.LONG on Ford. Currently, this is my favorite stock for the coming years. Yes, years.\n",

      "AMD as Intel,  divide servers processors sales into two types.  The hyperscalares, cloud providers, social media etc like Amazon Facebook Alibaba etc, and the enterprise datacenters like banks, financial institutions,  etc. There are other segments like telcos using server grade processors to manage the network and spread into edge datacenters including 5G at the tower micro cloud services. AMD was successful in getting its EPYC to cloud providers but enterprises were lagging as we've heard in the last ER.  But Lisa Su stated enterprises started to adopt EPYC through offerings from partners such as Dell, HPE, Lenovo,  Supermicro etc. So the last year's target of 10% servers market share was reached by cloud datacenters without the enterprises.  Now articles citing Mercury Research and even not reflecting Passmark seever market share show significant rise in AMD's servers share. Coupled with Intel's 20% decline in servers revenues shipping less units not just lower prices,  and the unprecedented expansion of datacenters not just cloud to support life with the corona tell the story.

AMD's server market share in Q1 was 3.8 points higher than the same period last year, the CRN report said -- citing data analytics firm Mercury Research.AMD sold fewer low-end CPUs and more high-end CPUs in the first quarter resulting in an overall increase in average selling prices for its chips, recording its fastest growth since 2006.\"This explains how AMD reported in its earnings that it had record server and client revenues, even though units were down in client and server units are far from the company's record shipments of 15 years ago,\" the report said citing Dean McCarron, president of Mercury Research.AMD designs microprocessors for the computer and consumer electronics industries. The majority of the firm's sales are in the personal computer and data center markets via CPUs and GPUs. See Also: AMD Is Firing On All Cylinders But Its Profitability Depends On Lean OperationsWHY IT MATTERS:AMD's server CPU market share peaked in 2006, rising from around 5%-7% to about 22% in only 18 months boosted by its 64-bit Opteron processors, according to the report. Intel however regained market share leading to a steady decline for AMD server CPU shipments over the following 10 years before the chipmaker started its comeback in 2017 with EPYC.AMD reported a strong earnings report last month, guiding a revenue growth of 50% YoY in 2021 whereas Intel expects a revenue decline of 1% YoY.\n",

      "search for this pdf: steelbenchmarker historyIn the 3rd and 4th paragraph it explains that the US mills are currently charging $1,382per net ton for steel products. Meanwhile China is charging $673.64 (Metric tonne divided by 1.1) I explained before that the main reason for why USA mills can make that much more additional profit is due to the surcharges that each port puts on every container coming from China. $9,000per 20' container weighing 44,000lbs. or $400 per ton. Plus all of the surcharges our ports are charging. That additional $708 of profit is an increase of 205%--How does this compare to 2008 when X was selling at $175?Go down to page 4 to see the price history.In the middle of 2008 Hot Rolled Band sold at $1,200 per metric tonne or $1,091 ton.--OK so the revenue should be about the same as 2008 since the current output now is less.However when comparing the chart in 2008 China was selling it at the same price they are now. The rest of the world is selling at a higher cost which is the extra profit they get to make due to shortages. The current spread is 33% higher than what it was back then.I'd also like to add that the world has about 150% more currency as compared to in 2008. Meaning that everything is much larger in comparison. So I think we should be comparing to about 9-12 months before the peak in 2008. I also feel that we are just beginning this climb of our economy coming back. It wasn't until 2004 when the Fed saw the economy was doing so good that they needed to start raising rates to slow it down. We aren't even at that level of concern.We can also use the lumber industry as a leading indicator. Still no decreases in sight.\n",

      "Nice little exploration / earn out opportunity ...Amarc Forms Alliance With Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc. To Advance Its JOY Copper-Gold Porphyry District, British Columbia   VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / May 12, 2021 / Amarc Resources Ltd. (\"Amarc\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:AHR)(OTCQB:AXREF) is pleased to announce it has entered into a Mineral Property Earn-In Agreement (the \"EIA\") with Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc. (\"Freeport\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX). Under the terms of the EIA, Freeport may acquire up to a 70% ownership interest by making staged investments in Amarc's JOY porphyry Cu-Au district (the \"JOY District\" or \"JOY\") in British Columbia (\"BC\"). The 482 km(2) JOY District covers the northern extension of the prolific Kemess porphyry Cu-Au district in the underexplored Toodoggone region of north-central BC. A geological region with high potential for important porphyry and epithermal deposits, the Toodoggone is part of BC's Golden Horseshoe, which includes the Golden Triangle to the W and NW. JOY is host to the open-ended PINE Cu-Au deposit, the promising MEX Cu-Au target and a pipeline of other large and high potential, drill-ready Cu-Au porphyry targets, which cluster on the property. \"We are delighted to welcome Freeport, a foremost global copper developer and miner, to JOY as a key funder and strategic partner in Amarc's campaign to realize the considerable copper-gold district potential of this very prospective property,\" said Amarc President & CEO, Dr. Diane Nicolson. \"The strength of the alliance, in my view, lies in the Amarc team's depth of knowledge and porphyry copper-gold discovery track record in BC and the Toodoggone region, combined with Freeport's global capabilities as a top-tier copper producer,\" said Nicolson. \"Our teams share not just a common vision for the exceptional discovery potential of the JOY District, but a passion for the responsible development of copper assets in North America to help fuel our society's transition to renewable energy, electrification and a low-carbon future.\" Permits for drilling and ground geophysical surveys are in place at JOY. Nicolson reports that the team is currently finalizing plans for a comprehensive 2021 exploration program that will advance deposit delineation and understanding of known areas of extensive mineralization, and assess several other important-scale targets. JOY District Agreement with Freeport Under the terms of the EIA, Freeport has a two-stage option to earn up to a 70% ownership interest in the mineral claims comprising the JOY District, plus other rights and interests, over up to a 10 year period. To earn an initial 60% interest, Freeport is required to fund CDN $35 million of work expenditures over a 5-year term. During the first year of the earn-in, a $4 million work program is planned in the JOY District. These optional earn-in expenditures can be accelerated by Freeport at its discretion. Amarc will be operator during the initial earn-in period. Once Freeport has acquired such 60% interest, Amarc and Freeport will proceed to operate the JOY District through a jointly owned corporation with Freeport assuming project operatorship. Upon Freeport earning such 60% interest, it can elect, in its sole discretion, to earn an additional 10% in the mineral claims comprising the JOY District, plus other rights and interests (for a total 70% interest) by sole funding a further CDN $75 million within the following five years. Once Freeport has finalized its earned ownership interest at either the 60% or 70% level, each party will be responsible for funding its own pro-rata share of project costs on a 60:40 or 70:30 basis. JOY District Highlights The JOY District is located on the northern extension of the prolific Kemess porphyry Cu-Au district, which includes the former Kemess South mine, the permitted and development-stage Kemess North underground deposit, and the advanced-stage Kemess East underground deposit - all currently held by Centerra Gold Inc. (\"Centerra\"). Through its association with HDI, Amarc's technical team was first to recognize the Kemess District's true porphyry potential, acquiring both Kemess North and Kemess South as early-stage prospects and advancing both to significant porphyry Cu-Au deposits. Kemess South was sold on beneficial terms to a predecessor of Northgate Minerals, which brought the deposit into production. JOY is accessed via resource roads servicing the southern end of the Toodoggone region, including Centerra's Kemess porphyry Cu-Au deposits and the historic Lawyers, Baker and Shasta epithermal precious metal mines. Amarc's 100%-owned consolidated mineral tenure at JOY hosts a pipeline of high quality targets, including: the PINE Cu-Au deposit, which remains open to expansion; the MEX Cu-Au deposit target; and, a number of other high potential drill-ready Cu-Au porphyry target\n",
      "COLUMN-Signs of investor vertigo as copper hits record highs -Andy HomeReutersMAY 11, 2021 9:00PM EDTBy Andy HomeExcerpts:But there is clear investor caution about a market that has risen in a near straight line for more than a year. Somewhat ominously, given China's role in the global copper market, Chinese investors appear particularly cautious.LACK OF CHINESE BUY-IN?If fund managers in the west appear to be wary about committing to copper at these heady prices, Chinese investors seem even less enthused.The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) copper contract's record high has been greeted by a sharp reduction in market open interest and plummeting volumes, which slumped to their lowest since October on Friday.China's massive physical purchases of refined copper, both commercial and state, have been the primary driver of the post-pandemic price rebound.But the import impetus is fading as China, like buyers everywhere, baulks at the price.Refined metal imports have been trending lower since the start of the year and continued doing so in April, to judge by the preliminary trade snapshot.And they're going to slow further.The Shanghai Metal Market Yangshan copper premium SMM-CUYP-CN is a closely watched barometer of China's physical import demand. It is currently assessed at $38.50 a tonne, the lowest print in a pricing series going back to 2017.The Chinese market, in other words, shows every signs of a glut, which is not surprising given the country imported 4.4 million tonnes last year, up 1.2 million tonnes from 2019.It's easy to see why Chinese speculators feel there are better bull plays in town. First and foremost is the steel sector, where the narrative has shifted from demand recovery to capacity curtailments.BUYING THE DIP?There is no evidence from the CME and LME positioning reports that fund money has been the primary driver of the last leg of the rally. Money managers are long but not excessively so by historical standards.Rather, the whippy price action above $10,000 a tonne bears all the hallmarks of short-covering, particularly in the LME options market, as traders scramble to cover exposure to call options granted at much lower prices.Copper was trading below $10,000 on Thursday, since when the price has rallied through June call option strikes holding over 140,000 tonnes of open interest. Each tonne of exposure has to be hedge-bought in the futures market, or hedge-sold if the price goes into reverse.There are still plenty of supercycle sceptics out there, who argue that copper won't hold at these elevated levels as the Chinese economy slows in line with receding stimulus. Many Chinese investors appear to be in that camp.However, even super-bulls now concede that the market may be in danger of overheating.Copper's rally began from a low of $4,371 a tonne in March last year and has done no more than pause for breath a couple of times before resuming. Since markets do not move in straight lines for ever, the collective fear of heights grows with every move upwards.========================================================================================China showing signs of a copper glut, according to Andy Home (and his research).Over 665,000 mt sitting in plain view in SHFE, INE, and bonded Shanghai inventory, Importers slowing purchases of refined copper metal, as well as copper concentrate.  And according to Home:  the only thing that's driving the latest bout of price increases is \"algorithmic black-box players, back in on the long side\", and short-covering on the LME.Not the stuff that super cycle bull markets are made from......See you soon boys and girls.......

      "How the Green Economy Will Be a Gold Mine for Copper, Barron‚Äôs May 8, Andrew Barry  # SCCO #TRQ Part 1 of 2Copper, a linchpin of the old energy economy, will play a crucial role in the new green one, too. Cables made of the metal are still the most cost-effective means of transmitting electricity from solar and wind sources, and it is a key material in charging stations and the electric vehicles that use them. Indeed, Goldman Sachs analysts say, there is ‚Äúno decarbonization without copper,‚Äù which they call ‚Äúthe new oil.‚ÄùSupplies, already tight as the global economy recovers, could be further strained by a predicted fivefold rise in green energy demand in the current decade, leading to significant shortages, starting in the mid-2020s, according to a report by Goldman commodity analyst Nicholas Snowdon. He sees copper, now around $4.50 a pound, hitting $6.80 by 2025. Bank of America commodity strategist Michael Widmer thinks the price could hit $6 this year.Shares of copper producers, up sharply in the past year as the metal‚Äôs price has doubled from a post-Covid low, still have room to advance.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), with mines on three continents, is the top play and the S&P 500‚Äôs only major copper stock. Barron‚Äôs wrote favorably on copper and Freeport in January. Other notable producers are First Quantum Minerals (FQVLF) and Southern Copper (SCCO), 89% owned by the Mexican conglomerate Grupo Mexico (GMBXF).The Global X Copper Miners exchange-traded fund (COPX) holds mining stocks, while the U.S. Copper Index fund (CPER) offers a direct play on the metal through ownership of futures contracts.The main risk to copper is unexpected weakness in the global economy. China is critical; it accounts for about half of worldwide demand. However, a pullback seems unlikely, given that green power-related demand, just 3% of copper usage in 2020, could hit 16% by 2030, the Goldman analysts estimate.An electric vehicle contains as much as 180 pounds of the red metal, four times the amount in an internal- combustion-engine vehicle. Onshore wind turbines use about four times as much copper as power plants fired by fossil fuels per megawatt of electricity. Offshore wind farms are even more copper-intensive; they need thick copper cables to transmit power onshore.\n",

That was down 12.2% from 552,317 tonnes in March and up 5.1% from April 2020.In April, activity in China's copper-intensive manufacturing sector, grew at a slower pace than expected as rising costs weighed on production.April imports of copper concentrate, or partially processed copper ore, totalled 1.921 million tonnes, down from March's record 2.171 million tonnes, and down 5.3% from 2.029 million tonnes in April 2020.========================================================================================Future's traders pop copper up a nickel on terrible import news from China.Copper is trading a 'charmed life' but looking at longer term charts from the last time copper was this richly priced, on has to ask that age old question:   Did it last?And neither did the historic moonshots of FCX stock in 2007-2008 or late 2010.That's why tomorrow I'll let the assignment happen.Adios longs, but it's getting time to figure a play on the other side of the line....esp. as copper gets further and further out on that branch.\n",

      "Is this payment, from Ericsson to Nokia, will be repeated in 2022 and 2023?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Telecoms gear maker Ericsson has reached an agreement with Finland's Nokia to pay a damages claim of 80 million euros ($97 million), it said on Wednesday.Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. It settled with the DoJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.The DoJ had said that Ericsson admitted to conspiring with others to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from at least 2000 to 2016 by engaging in a scheme to pay bribes and to falsify books and records and by failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls.Ericsson said on Wednesday the settlement would impact operating profit (EBIT) by 80 million euros and cashflow by 26 million euros in the second quarter.\"The amount reflects uncertainty, risk, expense, and potential distraction from business focus associated with a potentially lengthy and complex litigation,\" it said in a statement.The Swedish company added that the remainder of the settlement amount would be made in similar instalments in2022 and 2023, impacting cash flow.\"Nokia can confirm that the information in Ericsson's press release is accurate. We have no further comment,\" a spokeswoman said.Ericsson did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.\n",

NOK is also going to invest more in R&D and because of that the network branch is going to be +/- unprofitable, so if we take the numbers from 2020, the costs related to that are more or less 500 million euro's.If my calculations are correct, this means that the free cash flow of Q1 2021 is going to be reduced by 1.1billion euro and therefor the net cashflow is going to be +100 million euro.We assume that Q2 + Q3 + Q4 are going to be profitable at a 8% average OM, and the free cash flow of these future profits aren't going to be spend in the near future . therefor I believe that the free cash flow of 2021 is going to be arround 2 billion euro and the net cash more or less around 5 billion euro. If we look at the net cash of 2020 and we compare it with the possible net cash of 2021, I'm very bullish about the stock price.I'm aiming for a EOY SP 2021 = 5,62 EUR / 7,04 dollars => (3,14 EUR X 1,8) (3,91 USD X 1,8)And even at those prices I do think that NOK is way undervallued if the outlook is going to be achieved after 2023.Holding for atleast another 5 years\n",

      "Why Tesla will Fail in ChinaChina uses Tesla to spur on its own EV innovation and growthChina has NIO, Xpeng, Li Auto and dozens of new EV companies that will one day rival Tesla sales within China. While a huge first comer Tesla will eventually begin to lose market share globally as these Chinese native EV makers rise to prominence. This is how business and innovation works and China in the end will favor its own companies. This is why a Government deal saved NIO, making its stock go from $2 to $35. China will use Tesla to bolster its own companies, while giving Tesla a fair place in China to spur innovation.Just as with Apple phones, eventually the native Chinese brands catch up. Already at the end of 2020 the writing is on the wall of how this slowly begins to occur. NIO doubled sales recently. Xpeng delivered 3,040 vehicles, up 229% from less than 1,000 vehicles a year earlier. While both are companies likely 5 years behind Tesla, Chinese markets and money will push them higher.Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto are just a trio of companies in the sector but there are others. China will win the green tech race. BYD,  BAIC, there are literally dozens of others. Really good companies, totally unknown in the West. Tesla can win because of its brand image, but all things made in America don‚Äôt shine in the future. A future where Chinese companies will rule innovation.\n",

      "Haven't come to the board for a while, but still holding my long-term shares and only moved my trading money to other stocks.Reading some comments concerning the drop of the steel price next year. I don't think it will drop much, at least to the end of next year during to the following reasoning.The current steel price up is driven by a few reasons and below are the main ones.1. the tension betw Australia and China. China depends on Australian IO by 70% and feels difficult to replace it in a short period because China has poor IO resources and it takes time/capital to increase their capacity which was destroyed in the down cycle in the last decade. With the tension betw the 2, Australian IO pricing strategy would not change and China can't retaliate it with IO. (check coal as an example)2. China produced 50+% of the world steel in the past decade and part of the products flooded the world market due to the cheap IO price, lower cost(partly due to the missing environmental cost) and government subsidies. All 3 factors are going away which will impact the world supply side.3. the tension in the middle east and south China sea as well as pandemic reality are triggering an re-organization of the supply chain and increase of demand. In the past, 25-35% of US steel supply came from import. Now, with 232 as a plus, this part of the demand is shifting back to domestic producers, driving up the utilization of capacity to 78+%, the highest rate over the past decade. We will see this trend continuing.\n",

Lewis S√ÉO PAULO--Brazilian mining giant Vale SA reported its profit soared in the first quarter from a year earlier amid strong demand from China from a low level a year earlier because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions at the start of 2020.Vale said Monday it had net income of $5.5 billion in the period, up from $239 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net operating revenue rose to $12.6 billion from $7 billion in the year-earlier period. The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $8.4 billion, from $2.9 billion a year earlier.The company said earlier this month that iron ore output rose 14.2% from the first quarter of 2020 and sales of iron ore rose 14.8% from a year earlier. Net operating revenue from China jumped to $7 billion in the first quarter of this year from $3.2 billion in the same period a year earlier, Vale said.Demand for iron ore in China was stronger in the first quarter compared with a year earlier as the Asian country's gross domestic product surged, growing 18.3% in the same period. The rapid expansion of Chinese GDP was partly because of an economic slump at the start of 2020 caused by coronavirus pandemic-related social distancing measures.\"Without a doubt it's very important for Vale that China is one of the economies that most quickly recovered from the crisis,\" said Ilan Arbetman, an analyst at Ativa Investimentos. Vale's production of premium iron ore should also help the Brazilian company, Mr. Arbetman said, because China \"has been raising the bar for quality commodities and Vale's production from its operations at Carajas is purer\" than from other sources.Vale said demand from China could face an impact in the rest of 2021 because of environmental restrictions there, but added that expected high prices for steel in and outside of China should also help support iron ore premiums.\n",

But for this scenario, I'll just tell you that the most outrageous forecasts you read are actually what will happen. It has already. And it will continue to be the case. Remember there wouldn't be $50s oil? Then $60s? Then $70s? Then $80s? Then $100? Then ultra high net worthy accounts hear about almost $200? Yeah. And you think this isn't also geo-political? It's already been decided. And now you know. My gift to you. Don't bother arguing. You don't believe it. But you WILL remember reading this. I will get my $150m on RIG when it hits $15. You know the game is rigged - pun-intended. So just read. It's just information. I'm helpful. lolStrategy: pick your 2 best energy E&P companies AND RIG. Choose leaders. Hold them. The end. That takes care of \"equities.\" For an ETF, UCO is to be utilized (or some similar leveraged ETF) when you move from the $60s to $75-$80 level, upon which time an extended period of consolidation will take place (probably 2x the time we're in the $60s). THEN GET OUT! You reenter that ETF when the move from consolidation from that $75-$80 level happens. AND THEN YOU HOLD THROUGH $100 as the price of oil continues much higher. You get out after the final parabolic move, blow-off top, whatever you want to call it. Oil futures. Learn about them. Not necessary to trade them daily. They are to be utilized when you trend from the $60s to the next level - $75-$80 - and then sold; and similarly, repeat that from $80s trending up to past $100. Now 2 things. Don't dismiss futures trading as too difficult. We're NOT talking about trading it daily - just riding those trends. It's immensely profitable. Just learn about it and how little money you actually need. You'll learn about your p/l per $.01 move. You'll learn when to ADD to your position (as the price moves up). Learning about it doesn't mean you have to do it. It means you are informed. You may try. Even one mini-contract (during a trend). You'll get it. Easy and ridiculous return. To understand VISUALLY what I wrote about an ETF or oil futures, pull up a 1-year chart on oil. Look at the 3-month period from very end of November to very beginning of March. That's what I'm talking about will happen from $60s to $75-80. It will look exactly like that, and take approximately 3 months. So you have enough time to watch and wait and see the trend going before you enter those positions. And then the same thing from the move from $75-$80 to over $100. And resist the temptation to sell at $100. Once that is breached, it's going to be pandemonium. Instead of the trend from $80 to $100 having a positive 45 degree slope, or thereabouts, it will simply go parabolic - look like an over 70 degree positive slope. And that move past $100 will exhaust in probably weeks, not months. So that's when you would exit that ETF and the long oil futures positions. And you will STILL be holding the equity positions, as they will proceed to go higher for many months, even a year or two (and then consolidating).\n",

Let's put it on the high end and say sales will be 3.9x of 2019. That get's you to 616m in sales for bikes and still roughly 240m in subs. Play around with the sub number however you want. Plus 60m in precor revenue gets you to the projected 910m. So 27% in growth of connected fitness products (on high end), 40% growth in revenue of core business. All in all not terrible. So... why aren't they making money? Well, how about because they opened a ton of new retail locations to sell one product, bought a low margin equipment manufacturer, and keep giving executives millions of dollars in bonuses (in shares that they immediately sell). If earnings were increasing, this price might make sense. But they aren't. These products also cater to the affluent, which quickly saturates after the explosive growth that they saw. And on the retail locations, shouldn't this be a large contributor to growth? It should be, and the opening of those locations may be the only thing keeping them from projecting negative revenue growth. A projection I expect to occur for Q1 FY 2022.\n",
