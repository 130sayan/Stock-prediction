the Bullish Report on Snap Inc.https://chart-analysis.tools/SNAP

If you listened to every negative person along the way, including Jim Cramer for the first few years, you would never owned SNAP!  All I see is a stock going to $100 and then to $200.

Loving the action on $SNAP today. Technically speaking, spotting an inverse head and shoulders pattern. Fairly clear to see on 3m chart. Looking at a price target  $85-$100 if it breakouts above $65

Clear both $snap and amzn bringing the heat and the earnings this quarter.  Both undeniable prosperity for long investors.  Shorts still trying to find their way in this world.#juggernaut

Pretty smooth day for snap with market down.  Positive flywheel keeps turning for you guys.#blessings

so, theres no surprise that there have still been no downgrades at all - just seems to be an over reaction on the $1bn raise. Looks like the analysts average rate is $76, with a high closer to 100 bucks. If we can break past the 2 bump prices of 61 and 63 - we should get to the 70's rapidly. Let's face it, the earnings were powerful and that has to be the strongest  guidance announcement that SNAP have ever made. Short to mid outlook is strong, long term is going to make todays price look cheap.

PINS is more of a stay at home application, to browse and catalog ideas, especially home cooking recipes.  SNAP, especially with its recent acquisitions and projects, is meant to be used to share experiences and interact outside of the home.  SNAP has so much more growth and tech behind it.  They really aren't even comparable.  It's like comparing playing a video game to reading a book.

so someone bought 3.3m shares at 9.36am and then sold them again at 9.45am - and people are saying that this stock isnt being messed around with?

$7 trillion in ad spend is transitioning from traditional media to digital media companies like SNAP, FB and PINS. It is one of the great tailwinds of our time. These companies represent a powerful investment thesis. Betting on stocks like SNAP is like shooting fish in a barrel.

Snap: A Very Compelling Narrative, Why This Stock Is Worth Considering- Snap is more than just a revenue growth story, it's one of the fastest-growing global social media platforms anywhere.Snap's product lineup is richer than ever making its platform sticker than many investors believe.On the surface, the stock appears to be richly valued, but all considered, there's still much more upside potential.

SNAPPED -  I luv this company! - Very Bullish, Strong Buy and Positive at this level. Good luck all!

Three years and running.  So strong.  Congrats longs!

While we've all had a good laugh at shorts who have been destroyed over the part 3 years.  Even year-to-date I guess.  Just remember we have been compassionate.  We've provided them with stimulus checks out of our pockets.#compassionatewinning

Huge volume! $70 tomorrow!

Guys why are we even addressing Ken anymore. I mean we got better. We know it. So let’s spare ourselves some precious time.

@Dennis....SNAP is such a money making machine. I'm still shocked with the 66% Revenue growth. It all starts there ! I think the $80 PT is conservative.

Just glancing at the charts here.  3-year, 1-year and ytd.  For a newer company, their tech leadership and social media footprint is undeniable as has been their delivery of investment returns.#scoreboard

up on massive volume
