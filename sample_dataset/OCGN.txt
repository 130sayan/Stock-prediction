Very impressive finish today. Remarkable

On 1/11, I sold NIO at $64 a share. On 1/14, I was watching a TikTok video (plz don’t judge 😬) on OCGN. Bought 1100 shares of it at $2.30 per share. Didn’t know much about stocks, still learning! One thing I do know, I’m holding on to it. 🙏🏾thank you to the young man (can’t remember) for the content on OCGN. I’m one of the lucky ones who went with my gut and I finally picked a winner😀

Am i holding the winner?

I am holding 6k since $2.50 and will not sell until I see $50...To the Moon🚀🚀🚀

who's the institutional investor purchased 10 million shares of ocugen? wait for reveal in the next days!

Yesterday Shorties whispered in OCGN’s Ear, “Your Not Strong Enough To Withstand The Storm.”...........Today OCGN is Whispering back in Shorties Ear, “I am the Storm”......   OCGN Strong 💪

Folks, whether you believe or not, US will give clearance for COVAXIN and will fund it also because of it's superiority among the vaccines available. Buy and hold your shares for your better future  ahead.
