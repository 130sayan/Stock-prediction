Nokia Q1 2021 Earnings ProjectionTake what you want from this pre-earnings analysis from Zack's, but with all the recent success listed in the "Factors at Play" paragraph of this post, the most important one that will effect Q1 2021 results isn't even part of this list. That is T-Mobile's 5G Home Internet service launch which ships the Nokia FastMile 5G Fixed Wireless Access Router for connection. This service is surpassing T-Mobile's most optimistic forecasts and we will see the results in the Q1 numbers this week. Also, don't sleep on the Samsung Licensing agreement that Nokia finalized (this was a major miss by Ericsson). Zack's is forecasting $5.867B in revenue & .01 EPS for Q1. My forecast is $6.4B in revenue & .04 EPS in Q1.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-line-expansion-buoy-nokias-115411447.html

It‚Äôs really time to get out of the $4s onward to double digits. In a collaboration with the Nokia-driven #LuxTurrim5G ecosystem, we are connecting our autonomous vehicles and remote control center via LuxTurrim5G millimeter-wave 5G pilot test network in Espoo, Karamalmi. The remote control center enables remote operations of the vehicle, for example, remote overtaking if an obstacle is in the path of the autonomous vehicle. The improved data communications from gradually expanding 5G networks will reduce latency in-vehicle remote control. https://sensible4.fi/2020/12/02/three-features-that-5g-networks-will-enable-in-autonomous-driving/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=organic-042021&utm_content=260421

IBM creates cloud platform for the telecoms industry to realize full potential. April, 25 IBM signs up Samsung and Nokia as ecosystem partnersIBM is launching an open hybrid cloud platform for the telecoms industry, claiming it will help operators modernise their infrastructure and unlock the full potential of¬†5G networks.5G will deliver superior consumer services but the real potential is in the business market. Ultrafast speeds, enhanced capacity and ultra-low latency will allow mobile networks to power mission-critical applications for the first time and allow for the creation of entirely new use cases.However, this requires operators to rearchitect networks away from centralised, legacy core infrastructure and towards the cloud. By virtualising network functions, operators can rollout new services more rapidly, dynamically allocate resources to where they are most needed, and bring processing capabilities closer to the point of collection.IBM cloud for telcosThis necessity has seen significant convergence between the telecoms and technologies industries in recent years as vendors from both spheres collaborate to create joint-offerings that mix and match various IT and network technologies.‚ÄòIBM for Telecommunications‚Äô comprises a cloud platform and ecosystem of third-party vendors that promise to aid operators achieve this transition by allowing services to be built or deployed wherever they or their clients require ‚Äì in the cloud, on-premise or at the edge.The scalability of IBM‚Äôs ensures operators can easily meet growing demand for data and voice, while powerful software layers simplify the management of infrastructure, enable automation, and reduce costs. Operators can maximise data assets and rapidly roll out new services that meet customer requirements and drive revenues.Beyond the core cloud platform, IBM has created an ecosystem of more than 35 partners, including major telecoms network manufacturers, software vendors, and hardware specialists. This includes Cisco, Dell, Intel, HPE, Nokia and Samsung.As part of the project, Nokia and IBM will create a fully-functioning cloud-based 5G network that will allow operators to quickly provision private 5G services for enterprises, while IBM will work with Samsung and Red Hat to create AI-based services for Industry 4.0 deployments.‚ÄúWe believe that our service provider customers will benefit greatly from having an additional choice to quickly and efficiently deploy private 5G networks,‚Äù said Jane Rygaard, Head of Edge Cloud, Nokia. ‚ÄúThe transition to 5G will be a key step for industries to deliver on their digital transformation plans. Having multiple options of cloud-based solutions will help our industry build this path forward.‚Äù¬†Rivals Microsoft and Google have both made significant investments in their telco capabilities both in terms of creating new services and through acquisitions.

Verizon private 5G and NokiaWith Verizon, Nokia gains a telco partner with one of the largest enterprise divisions in the world. Last year, Verizon Business made about $31.4 billion in sales, roughly 24% of the company‚Äôs total, and many of its customers have a worldwide presence.I would not say that Nokia is out, even is US, just wait..=)Lots of private 5G networks all over planet, Associated British Ports, Air Force, NCCoE ect..

A very very undervalued stock with big manipulation this should be at least 10$ big tech giants wouldn‚Äôt partner up with Nokia if they are doing some something bad so clearly they are doing something right, and for those who think Nokia is based of the phones it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs 5G
