A clarification is needed regarding shorting stocks that pay cash dividends.Anyone who shorts a stockis responsible for paying any associated dividends.A company is not responsible for paying dividends to anyone on the buy side of a short sale.An illustration is in order.Let us assume that a company has one million shares outstanding.The upcoming dividend is $.50 per share.Hence the company will pay out $500,000 in dividends. If 100,000 shares have been sold short,there will be 1,100,000 shares that are entitled to the $.50 dividend.The company will pay $500,000 in dividends and the short sellers are responsible for paying the dividends on the 100,000 shares sold short.Some people erroneously believe that the company will pay dividends in the above example on 1,100,000 shares.The latter is incorrect.

Is it gonna be sell in May and Go away??? for Wal street?$msft, $nio, $tsla, $aapl, $jnj, $sbux, $lulu, $bac, $pltr, $nkla, $dis etc????Should I sell and take cash and come back in Sep???

Best of luck with the short sale.Please bear in mind that as a short seller you will be responsible for paying for any dividends during your short selling position.Also the company is involved in a big Capital return to shareholders program including share buybacks and probably a soon to be announced dividend increase.Finally,please note that Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway owns almost 12% of the common shares of Bank of America.Also Berkshire Hathaway had been granted permission by the Federal Reserve to own up to 24.9% of Bank of America stock without being required to become a bank holding company which entails lots of paper work and regulations.

Bought more today.  This stock trades on rates, which are way down today (10 year yield at 1.55%). When the 10 year yield gets to 2%, BAC will be at $45-$50.

I love when my stocks crush earnings and then they go down. It makes me feel so good. Then you can buy a stock like TESLA whose earnings donâ€™t support the price or SNAP who keep posting losses every year and they continue to go up.  Do I even need to mention GME??? This market makes absolutely no sense whatsoever which tells me there is a bubble still loomingï¿¼ or the Robinhood traders are taking over and buying based on Reddit trends and not true fundamentals like us old people ðŸ¤£

When will BAC raise it's dividend?  It's 1.86%!  They just had great earnings - it's time to reward shareholders.  Buying back stock does nothing for shareholders.  If they want cash instead of stock, they can sell anytime they want.  25 billion can pay a LOT of dividend.  If BAC doesn't want the diividend increase locked in future periods, let them declare a "special" for 2021

BAC has had a remarkable bull market, just like most stocks have had, during these past 6 months! Sure, BAC was a disappointment during the previous 4 years, but things have changed! Congratulations to all BAC shareholders, especially us long-termers!

Here's a sidebar semi-OT CNBC is chatteing about right now.  And it does make one sit up and go...hmmmm.....crypto....BTC, ETH, et.al.  Especially the likes of Coinbase.  They are starting to morph into looking like Banks.  They're offering interest on your holdings.  And the crypto represents an end run around the likes of Visa, Mastercard, etc., by folks being able to complete transactions without using them.  Case in point, Time Inc now taking crypto for subscriber payments.  It seems there's a brave new world coalescing in the digital world of finance.  And much like big auto got caught flat-footed by the likes of EV's so, too, could the traditional banks?  Just something to make you go HMMMMMM???

I am cashing out this week. Look at MSFT SP movement people are selling taking profit! $msft, $nio, $tsla, $aapl, $jnj, $sbux, $lulu, $bac, $pltr, $nkla, $dis , $goog, $gs, $wfc

Back over 1.6% on the 10 year and up only a whimper?  Supposing equal treatment on the way down through 1.6% doesn't apply lol.  Buy.

Short Stocks and Dividend PaymentsShorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price.If the price falls, there is a profit. If the price rises, there is a loss. The stock needs to be borrowed from a shareholder to sell it without owning it. A brokerage firm usually handles this process. There is generally a borrowing fee for the stock, depending on its availability and liquidity. Additionally, the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any dividends.

40 percent capital gains.....no sense investing.....

Bank of America Profit Doubles -- 2nd Update -- 8:39 am ET April 15, 2021 Bank of America Corp. said Thursday that its profit doubled in the first three months of the year.The Charlotte, N.C.-based lender posted earnings of $8.05 billion in the first quarter. That compared with $4.01 billion a year earlier, when banks took big hits to their earnings to begin stockpiling rainy-day reserves at the beginning of the pandemic.The bank made 86 cents a share, beating the 66 cents forecast in a FactSet poll of analysts.Earnings from the largest banks have reflected heightened optimism about an economic rebound. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. said Wednesday they both released money they had socked away last year to cover widespread loan defaults.Bank of America said it released $2.7 billion of its reserves, boosting its bottom line. Charge-offs were down from a year earlier.Like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America also benefited from a crazy quarter on Wall Street. Higher trading revenue and investment banking fees helped power earnings.Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has long expressed optimism about the economy, saying consumer spending is picking back up."We believe that progress in the health crisis and the economy point to an accelerating recovery," Mr. Moynihan said in a statement.The bank now expects U.S. gross domestic product to return to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year, Paul Donofrio, chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters. A few months ago, the expectation was that GDP wouldn't return to those levels until 2022. Such forecasts help determine how much the lender sets aside for bad loans.But America's second largest bank is still managing through the crisis, which ushered in record low rates. That has eroded the spread between what banks pay to borrow and what they earn from lending. Net interest income totaled $10.2 billion in the first quarter, down 16% from $12.13 billion a year earlier.Like other banks, the lender's book of loans continued to shrink, reflecting soft demand from consumers and businesses. Outstanding loans and leases also dropped by 14% to $903.01 billion.Noninterest income rose 19% to $12.62 billion, from $10.64 billion a year earlier, helped by fees in its capital-markets businesses.Adjusted trading revenue rose 17% to $5.08 billion from $4.34 billion a year earlier. By comparison, trading revenue rose 47% at Goldman and 25% and JPMorgan.A boom in mergers and stock offerings boosted investment-banking divisions, particularly those working with special-purpose acquisition companies. Bank of America also benefited, led by equity issuance. Investment banking fees rose 62% to $2.25 billion, from $1.39 billion a year earlier.Altogether, the bank's revenue was flat at $22.82 billion, from $22.77 billion a year ago. Still, that beat the $21.9 billion analysts had forecast.The bank separately said its board approved a $25 billion share buyback plan. The Federal Reserve has said its restrictions on shareholder returns will expire at the end of June.Bank of America shares rose in premarket trading Thursday. Bank stocks have been hot this year, rising more than the broader market after falling sharply when the coronavirus hit the U.S. last year.The bank's expenses jumped 15% in the first quarter to $15.52 billion, from $13.48 billion a year ago. Bank of America noted some one-time expenses, including about $300 million from incentive compensation changes and $160 million in severance.A boom in mergers and stock offerings boosted banks' investment-banking divisions, particularly those working on special-purpose acquisition companies. Bank of America also benefited, led by equity issuance. Investment banking fees rose 62% to $2.25 billion, from $1.39 billion a year earlier.Adjusted trading revenue rose 17% to $5.08 billion from $4.34 billion a year earlier. By comparison, trading revenue rose 47% at Goldman and 25% and JPMorgan.

Going to buyback $25B worth of stock.  According to Yahoo, there are 8.6 billion shares outstanding.  If they buy back $25B and do not issue any, the count will fall to 8B.  Or...they could send out almost $3 in dividend rather than buy back stock.  Which would you prefer?

Buybacks bring share count down, and push EPS up. Do them long enough and share price can exceed JPM. If you don't want that kind of return and want dividends to pay taxes on every quarter, sell and move on. There are lots of new long term investors that want your shares.

William,thank you very much for proving my statements wrong about short selling and educating me.For you,I have put aside my 50 years of business experience,portfolio management for some very largecompanies,managing my own portfolio,my M.B.A. in Finance which included grades of A in all Finance Courses,and my studying and following the teachings of Warren buffet and Charlie Munger. Your knowledge and revelations should be followed by those who wish to be misinformed.

CFRA MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF BANK OF AMERICA CORP. - 2:00 pm ET April 15, 2021 We raise our target by $8 to $40 using forward P/E of 13.1x our 2021 earnings estimate and wider risk premium than 5-year historic average at 12.0x, given our view BAC's operating performance will benefit from a strong U.S. economy for the rest of 2021. We raise our 2021 EPS estimate by $0.80 to $3.05 and 2022's by $0.45 to $3.20. BAC post Q1 2021 EPS of $0.86, a $0.21 earnings beat to consensus with wider margins but flat revenues Y/Y. In Q1 2021, net interest income (NII) declined 16%, with the net interest yield at 1.68%, down 65 bps Y/Y, alongside lower rates and lower loan activity. BAC states a 100 bps increase from a rising yield curve and modest loan growth would equate to a NII benefit of $1.0B by Q4 2021. Non-interest income increased 18.7% with higher card income (+12.8%), deposit and lending fees (-8.1%), asset management fees (+11.9%), investment banking fees (+61.8%), and market making or trading (-25.7%). In Q2 2021, BAC expects reserve levels to move lower with lower credit risk exposure.

I heard about BAC the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Itâ€™s looking like an interesting play.

Bid being held, and tracking, the intraday downtrend line off the high.  Bid $39.53
