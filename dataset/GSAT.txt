Open Interest in the 100k for July exp; $4 strike with no volume traded on the run up yesterday! Can this stock hit 4-5$??

$QCOM earnings tmw. Last time QCOM CEO made a comment that lifted $GSAT to $2.

With this volume, people are selling straight into shorts hands.  Hold your shares, make some real money.

Make ur sell limit to 30$+ ....... save ir shares from shorties............

I was positive that this stock was manipulated big time to shake the weak hands of retail investors. I didnâ€™t sell a share and will not until it hits $5 ! There are recent positive news about the company so it should be trading higher than simply the $1 range. Hope all are enjoying the excitement here ðŸ¤©

Any chance this stops dropping today and actually turns around for some profit?

fml i bought at the opening @1.52 omg i am scared HALP !

Wow, the boards are becoming just ads for small investment websites/etc...

Got in at +20% today.Usually would never buy in that high but after doing research, I realized Iâ€™m still in at a undervalued price

Iâ€™ve been following the CEPT/ECC approval process in the EU. Today, the status of their technical approval finally changed from pending to finalized. This probably means that an EU Decision on band 53 is near. http://eccwp.cept.org/WI_Detail.aspx?wiid=749

After recent news I have complete confidence this will go back to $3.00 closer to earnings release date. Good entry point right now to double your money.

Should I take a chance and buy a thousand shares !! I'm tired of losing....I need a winner.

Just a question.  Does anyone see a scenario whereby Globalstar is part of the infrastructure bill? Free 5G wifi to the underserved...  Is that even possible?

Was there any news coming out today? I have shares of GSAT, but haven't follow to much this company...

Sold half my shares to lock in some profits at the close and AHs... happy with how today turned out. What a difference a few days make!!!

This is steadily going up until September. Hopefully a better earnings report and a big partnership will bring this to 5-10$

Hey! +2,94% is good, but +29,94% is better!
