Brazil lowered 'for one week' the mix of soybean oil in diesel from 13% to 3%, due to the price at the pump of diesel and the high price of soybean oil.  They call also export the soy. Creates more oil based liquid ... 3% as part of the sale.perversely Good for PBR

Just Bought PBR Today...It Won't Be Long Till We Trade Above $10.

Just 2 stocks I own are down.........PBR and INTC.I only owned 100 INTC before earnings so no big deal there, but I have more than 10,000 PBR shares here before Earnings..........I'm expecting Huge earnings from PBR next Thursday so I am willing to get more if they keep enticing me like they are here today.

Just remember we were shy of $12 when downgrades came fast and furious thinking this was a socialist Venezuelan intervention. Nothing farther from the truth. CEO Luna confirms today PBR will take care of shareholders “"Growing sustainably in world-class oil and gas assets in deep and ultra-deep waters, incessantly looking for low costs and efficiency. And doing everything while reconciling the interesting of consumers and shareholders, valuing our oil workers, looking to reduce volatility without disrepecting international parity."”Reuter’s.

Very attractive 4.5% yield with 100% price appreciation over next several years...what other oil company comes close?  NONE.   There is the Brazilian politics which is incredibly circular and self deaf eating at time...but look at what we have in good ole USA

Buy PBR before earnings to make money!https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tot/balance-sheet?p=totCheck:  Net Debt, where it was back in 2017 or 2018 and check where it's at Today........Compare Net Debt to other Oil companies who have seen it INCREASE!Huge profits at PBR!

Oil Production will probably be flat or down 2%............Who cares while Earnings are UP Hugely!   Watch that debt reduction be down more than $15B this year causing Dividend to be like 10% at a stock price of $8.50/shr.     They'll have to trade Up above $16 to get the Dividend down to 5%.

ex dividend at $ 8,49 = $ 8,21. Should rise on market circumstances and Q1 forecast.

JPM upgrade PT $11.

Simple Math can be used:2.7M BOE/day$70 price/brl90 daysResults in:2.7MX$70x90= about $17B from Oil products for these 3 months Assuming a Constant $70 price..........Operating Expenses are LOW, like $5.5B/Quarter.I can't wait for that Report!

GS Downgrades to neutral from buy, $10.3 price target.

PBR making Huge Dollars while XOM is struggling to Lose money.

PBR Revenues will be higher than $19B with more than $4B Profits in my humble opinion.......They produced 2.77MBoed @ probably $74/Brl.     I’ll have to get the calculator out to see.   But, Revenues will be Similar to 4Q2019.     Earnings will Be Outstanding.

Earnings are on 5/13.........You get the Dividend on 4/29.

Lula will fix it all

I live in Sao Paulo and gas prices have actually gone up by quite a bit since Bolsonaro made changes at PBR....all that noise about reducing fuel costs has only created the wrong impression about Brazil. I would not be surprised to see PBR strengthening financially in the coming quarters.

I think PBR is making way more than $50M/day with Brent above $60...........Remember, they reduced capex so mainly profits.

Remember that each ADR share of PBR represents two shares of the underlying Brazilian stock.  So you will get a double dividend if you own the ADR shares; which should calculate to around $0.28 USD per share, not bad for an $8 stock!

Raise your sell limits to $15 or higher. No reason to get out of this one too soon.

Im about to make a sizable purchase in pbr since i just received some mula. but what if the government of brazil decides to not honor the shares? could that happen?
